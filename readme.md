## Description

The Metrists webpack is a WebPack plugin that helps you include your localization files in your webpack build.

Metrists webpack is intended to be used with a [Metrists CLI](https://github.com/metrists/metrists-cli), and a internationalization library. We highly recommend that you use [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) with Metrists.

## Installation

```
npm install @metrists/webpack
```

or using yarn

```
yarn add @metrists/webpack
```

## Creating a .metristsrc file

The best way to configure Metrists on your repository is to create a `.metristsrc` file in the root directory of your project. This way this package, and [Metrists CLI](https://github.com/metrists/metrists-cli) will reference a single source of truth about your localization.

an example `.metristsrc`:

```
{
  "resolvePath": "src/locals",
  "fetcher": "github",
  "envPath": ".env",
  "fetcherParams": {
    "repo": "env.LOCALS_REPO",
    "org": "env.LOCALS_ORG"
  }
}

```

### Differentiating Build Path from Development

By default, Metrists will copy paste the contents of your `resolvePath` argument in your build folder. If you wish to configure a different route inside the build, you can use the **`resolvePathBuild`** parameter, to differentiate your build path:

```
{
  "resolvePath": "src/locals",
  "resolvePathBuild": "locals",
  "fetcher": "github",
  "envPath": ".env",
  "fetcherParams": {
    "repo": "env.LOCALS_REPO",
    "org": "env.LOCALS_ORG"
  }
}

```

## Webpack Configuration

Once installed, you need use `CopyMetristsFiles` inside your webpack configuration, as a plugin:

Webpack config file:

```js
const CopyMetristsFiles = require('@metrists/webpack');
// Webpack config object
return {
  plugins: [CopyMetristsFiles()],
};
```

If you have created and configured your `.metristsrc`, the plugin will read your configuration and move the file to the correct spot inside the build. If you are not using `.metristsrc`, you can [pass your resolvePath directly to the plugin](#no-metristsrc-file).

## No `.metristsrc` File

If you wish to not create a `.metristsrc` configuration file, you can pass a `resolvePath` and optionally a `resolvePathBuild` to the plugin directly:

The output of all fetchers should look like this:

```js
const CopyMetristsFiles = require('@metrists/webpack');
// Webpack config object
return {
  plugins: [
    // plugins here...
    CopyMetristsFiles(
      resolvePath: 'src/locals',
      resolvePathBuild : 'locals'
    )
  ],
};
```

> ðŸŒ• If you do not pass in a `resolvePathBuild` to the plugin, the plugin will use `resolvePath` as the build path too.
